/**
 * A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.
 * 
 * Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its
 * index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the
 * peaks.
 * 
 * You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. In other words, an element is
 * always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the
 * array.
 * [1,2,3,4,3]
 * You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.
